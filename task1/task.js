/**
 * GOAL:
 * Fill in the function below in a way that completely satisfies the requirements.
 * 
 * Inputs:
 * - canvasWidth, canvasHeight: width and height of canvas (area to be covered)
 *    in pixels
 *  - imageAspect: aspect ratio of image (width / height)
 *
 * Output:
 *  - Array containing the following:
 *    - xpos, ypos: calculated image position offset relative to canvas in pixels
 *    - sizex, sizey: calculated image size in pixels
 *
 * Coordinate system: 0,0 is upper left
 *
 * REQUIREMENTS:
 * 1. Size the image to cover the canvas area completely.
 * 2. Covering should be minimal - image should be no larger than necessary to 
 *    cover the canvas area.
 * 3. Must maintain original aspect ratio of the image.
 * 4. Center the image on the canvas
 *
 * The function should only return the values specified under Output above.
